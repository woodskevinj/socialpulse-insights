# Data Directory

This folder stores all datasets used by **SocialPulse Insights**.

## Structure

  processed/  # Cleaned, enriched, and transformed data
```

## FYI's

`raw/`

Place original, unmodified datasets here. For example:

- `data/raw/sentiment140.csv`

Do **not** commit proprietary or licensed data to a public repo.

`processed/`

This is where intermediate and processed artifacts will be saved, such as:

- `data/processed/sentiment140_cleaned.parquet`

- `data/processed/tweets_with_entities.parquet`

These files are typically generated by scripts or notebooks in the project and should be treated as **derived artifacts**, not source-of-truth data.
